    <h1>TSA Motto</h1>
    <h2><i>"Learning to lead in a technical world..."</i></h2>
    <p>Following TSA's mission statement, our chapter strives to promote a community of discovery and collaboration. With the help of our officers and advisor, we hope to spark passion for the increasingly STEM-oriented future at our schoool.</p>
    <i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin fa-lg"></i>
    <p>Since its establishment six years ago, our chapter has won multiple finalist finishes and grown to hold over sixty members.</p>

    <img src="tsaimg/tsalogo.png" alt="Georgia TSA Logo">
    <br><br>
    <p><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> TSA (Technology Student Association) is a national organization dedicated to developing student leadership in STEM-related fields. Students have the opportunity to participate in multiple competitive events and leadership conferences, where they can display and cultivate their technological passions.</p>
    <br>
    <p><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Students will have the opportunity to select and work on their choice of competitive events throughout the school year. At the end of the year, our chapter will attend Georgia TSA's annual State Leadership Conference in Athens to submit student projects for competition.</p>
 	
 	<br>
    <div class="jumbotron">
    	<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    	<p>The Technology Student Association (TSA)﻿﻿ enhances personal development, leadership, and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), whereby members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular activities, competitions, and related programs.</p>
  	</div>

    <h2>TSA Creed</h2>
    <p>I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live.</p>
    <p>I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.</p>

At these general meetings, we go over important information and updates about our chapter and each competitive event. Starting January, event check-ups start as well. After meetings, officers will go over each event's progress so far. This is so that they can provide feedback, answer questions, and give recommendations.</h3>
