    <p>SPIRE utilizes project-based, technology-enhanced instruction to teach through an engineering lens. Students have the opportunity to work hands-on with engineering concepts through collaboration. The program has been awarded the STEM certification by the Georgia Department of Education. Ridge currently offers two different SPIRE pathways that students can follow throughout their high school years. These classes integrate engineering into general science & math classes.</p>

    <p><i>"These graduates may become involved in STEM careers as a result of the increased collaboration and professional development within our school focused on increasing relevancy in the classroom as we prepare the next generation of leaders. STEM is not 'a part' of what we do 'for some of our students'. It is a tool to increase our graduate's options as well as “seal the leaks” in the STEM pipeline. Daily, we work to decrease variability between our classrooms and embrace the evolution of relevance and rigor for all of our students."</i> - Dr. Jeff Mathews, Principal.</p>

  <h3>The teachers that teach these classes are certified in a specific technical field. Students that finish these pathways will have the chance to take a End of Pathway Assessment. These assessments are an industry recognized certification. Each pathway also has a certain club related to it.
